# API Integration Update Summary

## Components Updated to Use API Data

All major components have been successfully updated to integrate with the backend API at `https://dash-1-iefb.onrender.com/`. Here's what was completed:

### Core Infrastructure

✅ **API Service Layer** (`lib/api.js`)

- Enhanced with extraction functions for all sections (8-17)
- Added fallback handling and data normalization

✅ **DataContext** (`contexts/DataContext.js`)

- Updated to include all new section extractors
- Global loading and error state management

### Main Sections Updated

✅ **Section8** - Feature cards with icons and descriptions

- Uses `data.section8` from API
- Maps icons dynamically based on titles
- Loading states and error fallbacks

✅ **Section9** - Capabilities section with tabs

- Uses `data.section9` from API
- Dynamic tab content and statistics
- Complex interactive UI with API integration

✅ **Section10** - Image grid section

- Uses `data.section10` from API
- Background images and overlay effects

✅ **Section11** - Team section

- Uses `data.section11` from API
- Team member cards with photos and descriptions
- Dynamic header content

✅ **Section12** - Parallax concept section

- Uses `data.section12` from API
- Features grid and content area
- Icon mapping based on content

✅ **Section13** - Contact CTA section

- Uses `data.section13` from API
- Call-to-action button with dynamic links

✅ **Section15** - Partners/brands section

- Uses `data.section15` from API
- Logo grid with hover effects
- Partner/brand image handling

✅ **Section16** - Contact info section

- Uses `data.section16` from API
- Contact information cards with icons

✅ **Section17** - Final CTA section

- Uses `data.section17` from API
- Hero-style call-to-action with background

### News Components Updated

✅ **NewsDetails** - News detail page component

- Uses `data.news` from API
- Dynamic news article details
- Social sharing integration

✅ **NewsSlider** - Image slider for news

- Uses news-specific image galleries
- Swiper.js integration with API data

### Features Implemented

- **Loading States**: All components show loading spinners while data loads
- **Error Handling**: Components gracefully fall back to static data on API errors
- **Data Mapping**: Smart mapping of API data to component expectations
- **Icon Integration**: Dynamic icon selection based on content
- **Responsive Design**: All components maintain responsive behavior
- **Fallback Data**: Comprehensive fallback data for all components

### API Integration Pattern

Each component follows this pattern:

1. Import `useData` hook from DataContext
2. Extract relevant data with fallbacks
3. Show loading state while data loads
4. Handle errors gracefully with console logging
5. Use API data with static fallbacks as backup

### Server Status

✅ Development server running successfully on `http://localhost:3000`
✅ All components load without errors
✅ API integration working as expected

## Next Steps

- All main components are now integrated with the API
- The application can handle both dynamic API data and fallback static data
- Ready for testing with live API endpoints
- Documentation updated in `API_INTEGRATION.md`

The integration is complete and the application is fully functional with both API data and robust fallback mechanisms.
